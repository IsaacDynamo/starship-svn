SVN support for [starship.rs](starship.rs) via a custom commands.

## How does it work
`starship-svn` runs and parses the `svn info` of the working directory.

SVN only has a branch name by convention. The name is derived from the `svn info` URL. This is done
with the assumption that the repo uses the conventional trunk/branches/tags repository layout. If
the URL path contains a folder named 'trunk', the branch name is trunk. If the URL path contains a
folder named 'branches' or 'tags' the next folder is considered the branch name, if it is not
blacklisted.

If your branch named folder is not a direct child of 'branches' or 'tags' the inbetween folders can be blacklisted.
The algorithm continues to scans right for a branch name until a non blacklisted folder name is found.


## Install
`starship-svn` uses `svn` CLI so make sure it is installed. This can be checked with `svn --version`.

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/IsaacDynamo/starship-svn
